Python 100 Days Bootcamp – Progress Log

This repository documents my journey through Python 100 Days Bootcamp by Angela Yu.  
The goal is to build strong Python fundamentals, problem-solving ability, and real-world project experience by coding daily and tracking progress honestly.

Course Progress
Completed: Day 1 – Day 25  
Status: Ongoing

What I’ve Learned So Far

Days 1–5: Python Basics & Logic
- Variables, data types, and type casting
- Input/output operations
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Logical operators
- Simple debugging mindset
- Built small beginner projects (calculator, band name generator, etc.)

Days 6–10: Control Flow & Functions
- Functions and parameters
- Code reusability
- Loops (for, while)
- Flow control with conditions
- Breaking problems into steps
- Strengthened logical thinking

Days 11–15: Data Structures
- Lists and list methods
- Dictionaries and key-value access
- Nested data structures
- Random module usage
- Game-based projects (guessing games, simple simulations)

Days 16–20: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Attributes and methods
- Constructors (__init__)
- Modifying object state
- Using external libraries
- Built interactive programs using OOP principles

Days 21–25: Intermediate Python & Projects
- Working with files (read/write)
- Error handling and debugging
- Understanding scope and namespaces
- More complex project structures
- Strengthened problem decomposition
- Writing cleaner and more maintainable code
- Pandas Library

Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- Command Line
- Python Standard Library

Key Takeaways So Far
- Consistency matters more than speed
- Debugging is a skill, not a weakness
- Writing readable code is as important as writing working code
- Projects accelerate learning faster than theory alone

Next Steps
- Continue from Day 26 onwards
- Focus more on automation, APIs, data handling, and real-world Python use cases
- Improve code structure and documentation

Update Log
- Day 25: Reached solid intermediate Python foundation and completed multiple structured projects

Note
This README will be updated regularly as I progress through the remaining days of the bootcamp.
